# CryptoHarvest

## Project Description

CryptoHarvest is a decentralized staking platform built on Ethereum that allows users to stake their ETH and earn passive rewards over time. The platform implements a time-based reward mechanism where users can stake tokens, accumulate rewards based on the duration of their stake, and harvest or unstake their tokens at any time. The smart contract ensures transparency, security, and fair distribution of rewards to all participants.

The platform operates on a simple yet powerful principle: the longer you stake, the more you earn. Users maintain full control of their assets and can withdraw at any time, making it a flexible and user-friendly solution for passive income generation in the DeFi ecosystem.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create an accessible and transparent DeFi staking platform that empowers users to grow their cryptocurrency holdings through sustainable yield farming. CryptoHarvest aims to:

- **Democratize Access**: Provide a simple, low-barrier entry point for anyone to participate in DeFi staking
- **Ensure Transparency**: All reward calculations and distributions are fully on-chain and verifiable
- **Promote Sustainability**: Implement fair and sustainable reward mechanisms that benefit long-term participants
- **Build Trust**: Create a secure and auditable smart contract that prioritizes user asset safety
- **Foster Community**: Develop a platform that grows with its community and adapts to user needs

## Key Features
